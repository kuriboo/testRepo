The image shows a software interface, likely an appointment scheduling system. The title at the top says "予算科目マスタ" which translates to "Budget Item Master" in English.

The interface contains various fields for inputting data such as the fiscal year, department code, item code, sub-item code, start date, end date, etc. There are also drop-down menus for selecting the accounting category and cost bearing department.

At the bottom are buttons labeled "前データ" (Previous Data), "次データ" (Next Data), "OK", "クリア" (Clear) and "終了" (End).

Overall, this appears to be a master data management screen for setting up and maintaining budget item information in an enterprise system, likely used by accounting or finance departments in Japanese companies.
